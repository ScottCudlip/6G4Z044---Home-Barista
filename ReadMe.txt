========== HOME BARISTA APP ==========

Home Barista is an at-home drink ordering app, similar to how you can order drinks in the 'Starbucks' app.

1.  There are 2 hardcoded user profiles, "Customer" and "Admin" which have different options/experiences within the app. The logins for these are below.

    Customer Profile...         |       Admin Profile...
    - Username = customer       |       - Username = admin
    - Password = cust123        |       - Password = admin123

2.  If Home Barista cannot find files needed for it's menus, it will create default menus with a small list of defualt menu items. The "Admin" user can create/remove items from each menu.

3. This is submitted with flushed out menu files in the .zip, but you can delete these .txt files and the programme will make new ones with default options in them.
