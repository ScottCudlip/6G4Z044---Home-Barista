=============================   HOME BARISTA APP  ============================

1.  Home Barista is an at-home drink ordering app, similar to how you can order drinks for collection from coffee shops.

2.  There are 2 hardcoded user profiles, "Customer" and "Admin" which have different options/experiences within the app. The logins for these are below.

    Customer Profile...         |       Admin Profile...
    - Username = customer       |       - Username = admin
    - Password = cust123        |       - Password = admin123

3.  If Home Barista cannot find files needed for it's menus, it will create default menus with a small list of defualt items. The "Admin" user can create/edit/remove items from each menu.
    This submission is uploaded with full-sized menus, including menu subtitles e.g.(Frappes) which can be read by the programme as subtitles by having '#' before and after the name. I was inspired to do this from using .YML files in my work
4.  All .txt files can be deleted, and the programme will create new ones.

5.  My self assesment is included in file structure as SelfAssessment.txt

6.  Programme versions managed in the later stages of development through use of GitHub.    https://github.com/ScottCudlip/6G4Z044---Home-Barista
