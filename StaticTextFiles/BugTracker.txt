[X] CUSTOMER    -  My order history screen has formatting issues
[ ] CUSTOMER    -  When adding extras, the screen should clear after confirmation message, otherwise likely to get another number input instead of y/n confirmation
[ ] CUSTOMER    -  Screen should clear again before asking if they want to add a note to the order.
